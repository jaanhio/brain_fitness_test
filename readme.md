# WDI Project #1: The Game

This is a memory game that requires users to remember the light up sequence and input the correct sequence correctly in order to proceed to next level.

Failure to do so will result in ending of game.

# Design process

As increasing number of users are moving towards the mobile platform, i have decided to take the mobile-first approach for my MVP. 

Sketch + invision are used to create a mockup.

To ensure an enjoyable user experience, layouts of components are carefully considered. 

I have decided to go for a clean minimalist approach that to make it clear what users have to do without further explanations.

Buttons and game components are centered and placed closer to bottom of screen to allow for comfortable access using one hand.
